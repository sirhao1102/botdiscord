  "Please note that registration for the defending party is only processed after the leader of the castle-owning Clan approves it.",
  "When a Siege begins, the inside of the castle and some of the neighboring areas are turned into a battlefield. A system message will tell you whether you’re on the battlefield or not. Sieges occur within the Castle of Giran and Castle of Goddard every Sunday for 1 hour starting from 20:00 server time.",
  "In the unlikely case of the server being unavailable or getting interrupted during a Siege, the Siege time will be extended for time lost. The HP and other statuses of the defending NPCs, the gates, camps will be the same as before the server down when the Siege restarts. Please note that all players within the battlefield will be unable to move before all NPCs are spawned.  When a Siege starts, the attacking and defending parties engage in large-scale, close fight combat.",

  "When a Siege starts, the attacking party should attempt to get into the castle to destroy the Holy Artifact in the Imprinting Room. Once the Holy Artifact is destroyed, the Guardian of Giran/Goddard appears between the outer and inner castle. Suppose the Clan leader of the attacking party uses an Imprint skill on the Guardian of Giran/Goddard and successfully imprints on it. In that case, the Clan achieves a mid-victory, and the attacking/defending party categories switch. The Guardian of Imprinting appears between the outer and inner castle after the Holy Artifact is destroyed.",
  "Other Clans of the attacking party, which failed to imprint and the Clans of the defending party are now the attackers. They can go on looking for a chance to imprint throughout the Siege. The Clan that last imprints by the end of the Siege will be the owner of the castle.",

  "Some active skills bestowed upon items cannot be used within the Siege battlefield.",
  "Players don’t lose XP upon death within the Siege battlefield.",

  "A character cannot pass through an enemy character (for a normal attack) in the Siege battlefield and vice versa.",
  "When a Siege ends, taxes are deposited to the castle vault, and the Castle Lord has the authority to change the tax rate from 0 – 10%. The castle takes 100% of all the taxes collected without paying a sum of money to the dominating castle.",
  "All merchant NPCs in each hunting zone and town now belong to the castle owners and have to pay the tax rate imposed by the castle (except for Clan Hall Merchant NPCs).",
  "The Spectator Mode, where one can watch a Siege, has been upgraded so one can now freely move around the Siege battlefield while watching the Siege.",

  "Clans that become the attackers or defenders can recruit mercenaries, up to 100 mercenaries per Clan. Mercenary recruitment and cancellation open every Sunday at 18:00 – 20:00 server time. If there is at least one mercenary applicant after recruitment opens, the recruitment cannot be canceled.",
  "Individual players or players whose Clans haven’t enrolled for the attacking/defending party can still participate in a Siege by applying to be a mercenary.

  "Tomorrow’s the big day and we’ve been working hard to bring Lineage II Aden to you. We highlighted the biggest features through detailed preview articles, but here is a list of everything that you can expect when Lineage II Aden launches.",
  "Pending any unplanned issues, the Aden service will officially open at 9:00 AM PDT.",
  "Two new classes premier for the Aden server launch; the Death Knight class (Male Human, Male Elf, Male Dark Elf) and the new Storm Blaster class for the Sylph race.",
  "During the golden age of Elmoreden, the Knights of Death, a secret subjugation group consisting of male-only Human, Elf, and Dark Elf warriors, dedicated their lives to preventing the fire dragon, Valakas, from gaining strength to bring peace to Aden.",
  "Evolved from the Ertheia, a once great and noble race, the Sylph Storm Blasters are hybrid combat with a tactical edge and style of fighting that consists of attack patterns proficient in both melee and ranged engagement and high maneuverability. Their speedy style of combat allows them to turn the tide of battle in their favor.",
  "All 36 classes have been overhauled completely to have their own self-sufficient buffs to allow for smooth and efficient solo hunting on the Aden server.",
  "Certain class skills will require spellbooks to learn that can be obtained from raid bosses or through special crafting.",
  "General transformation skills with different boosts have been added to all classes (except Death Knight and Jin Kamael, which have their own transformations). Characters can transform into a Pirate, Dark Assassin, White Assassin, and a White Guardian (requires a spellbook).",
  "The class you select can advance and that is called the Class Transfer System. There is up to 3 class transfers and it can be done by completing several steps (Clan transfer UI and Lv. 76 quest). The class branches out starting at the 2nd class transfer, so it is crucial to select the class you wish to advance to.",
  "Each character’s basic stats are displayed in the character information window (Alt + T). Each stat impacts the character’s combat prowess, and this combat prowess can be seen in the character information window.",
  "As a stat that shows STR, it is closely related to Attack Power. This is one of the most important basic stats for Fighter type classes that use P. Atk. Attack Power increases additionally if above STR 40, so Fighters who possess STR 40 and Dark Fighter, Orc Fighter possess higher Attack Power.",
  "As a stat that shows DEX, it is closely related to most combat figures related to P. Atk. It has the ability to increase Evasion and Atk. Spd. so it is a stat that is very important to Rogue type classes that wear Light Armor. It is the most important basic stat for classes related to STR and P. Atk.",
  "As a stat that shows CON, it is closely related to maximum HP and HP recovery. It is one of the most important basic stats to classes that prioritize survival in combat. CON is related to physical attributes such as Stun and Bleed, so players who enjoy Castle Sieges and PvP should consider CON increase dyes.",
  "As a stat that shows INT, it is closely related to M. Atk. It is the most important basic ability for classes who use M. Atk. such as Wizard type classes. Unlike Fighter type classes, INT is a core stat for Wizards with little pattern restrictions. However, Healer type classes cannot change INT figures.",
  "As a stat that shows off WIT, it is closely related to Casting Speed and M. Accuracy. WIT is one of the most important basic stats to Wizard type classes and is comparable to Fighter type’s DEX. It is a very important element in combat that increases Casting Speed, so players who enjoy Castle Sieges and PvP should consider WIT increase dyes.",
  "As a stat that shows off MEN, it is closely related to maximum MP and MP recovery. It is one of the most important basic stats to Wizard type classes and is comparable to Fighter type’s CON. It is related to mental attributes, so players who enjoy Castle Sieges and PvP should consider MEN increase dyes.",
  "Basic stats differ based on race, and additional stats can be acquired through equipment/dyes/items/skills.",
  "The Lineage II Aden server has seven races that coexist peacefully. Each race is distinguished significantly from each other in characteristics, as well as in appearance, so classes of the same type will slightly differ from each other in combat stats. Therefore, you should choose a class that fits you the best based on the unique stats of each race.",
  "The Sylphs are one of the Ertheia races created by Einhasad with the Soul of Wind, that developed on their own in Aden. They can use the power of spirits and worship the God of Wind, Sayha.",
  "Sylphs move quickly and act agilely, and mainly use a shooter and the power of Spirit. After completing the 1",
  "class transfer, their attack skill motions vary depending on the distance to the target, and their special skills deal different effects depending on the target.",
  "Humans were created by Gran Kain but they worship Einhasad, the Goddess of Light. They've mastered the powers of combat as well as magic and they are adept in any class role.",
  "Human Fighters are Fighters in the most basic form. All their basic stats are well-balanced so that they are good at adapting to any situation, but that also means they do not have any specialties. You will be able to make up for this by transferring to another class that is specialized for one of the stats.",
  "A Human Mystic will be the best you can get when you need a character that specializes in one thing. Human Mystics are able to use all elemental, support, white, and black magic, except Orc’s Evil Spirits magic. Each class superior to the Human Mystic specializes in using each of the magics, making them even more powerful.",
  "Created by Einhasad through the Mother Tree, Elves are agile and dexterous Deeply in tune with the forces of nature, they worship Eva, the Goddess of Water, and dwell in the protection of the Mother Tree.",
  "With higher DEX than other races, Elves show higher Evasion Rate and Attack Accuracy Rate. Also, they show great mobility in battles with high Movement Speed and Attack Speed. Another reason why you will find them attractive is, they are able to use support magic of varying kinds and have the recovery skill ‘Elemental Heal’. Elves are better than any other classes at using bows in attack thanks to their high DEX.",
  "Elven Mages, although not able to use black magic, have the ability to reinforce their friendly forces as well as themselves using the power of Spirit. With higher WIT and MEN than other races, they feature high Casting Speed and fast MP recovery.",
  "Dark Elves were once of the Elf race. They split off to pursue their worship of Shilen and dark magic, but she proved to be too evil and the Dark Elves now stand on their own.",
  "With high base Attack Damage and Evasion Rate, Dark Fighters are a good choice when you would like to focus on attacking. However, they have weak Strength, which means they might be at risk if a battle is prolonged. Dark Fighters are a class that kills enemies quickly using fast Attack Speed and high Critical Rate.",
  "Dark Mages specialize in using black magic with higher INT than any other races, which makes them feature the most powerful M. Damage. However, they have low WIT, which is why they have slow Casting Speed. Also, their MP recovers relatively slowly, so you might need to learn how to fight efficiently with this class.",
  "Orcs were created by fire to be a race of undying strength and stamina, in worship of the God of Fire Pa'agrio. Once servants of the Giants, Orcs are powerful warriors.",
  "Orc Fighters never get exhausted by fighting for a long time with their highest Strength, great resistance to poison, and quick HP and MP recovery. However, they have low Accuracy Rate and Evasion Rate and slow Movement Speed.",
  "Unlike other Wizard classes, Orc Mages use unique Evil Spirit magic, such as dealing damage to enemies over time or increasing Strength of their friendly forces. Also, they are as good at fighting as Fighters of other races, with high STR and CON. However, they have slow Casting Speed due to low WIT and lack magic skills that are very efficient.",
  "Dwarves were made from and worship the God of Earth Maphr. Their heartiness makes them excel at crafting, resource gathering, and heavy combat with multiple enemies.",
  "Dwarves cannot just be evaluated based on their basic stats. They are specialized for economic elements, such as finding and collecting hidden materials from inside monsters or crafting items. Particularly, they are a good choice in that they have great Strength and can carry many items, with high CON.",
  "Jin Kamael were created by the Gods as living combat weapons, but they refused the experiment of their creators and escaped. They use souls of living creatures in battle.",
  "Born as a result of numerous experiments combining the body and soul, Jin Kamael have the ability to use the souls of darkness and light, which gives them the ability to absorb a soul and use the inborn power. They have high P. Atk. and fast Attack Speed.",
  "The following chat restrictions by level will be implemented for launch week:",
  "Field raids will be available at launch. One characteristic is that a raid spawns after a specific amount of time with high difficulty, and it provides opportunities to obtain very rare and special items.",
  "Field raids designate raid monsters that can be checked in the World Map (ALT+M).",
  "There is a difference in the scale of individual and command channel field raids, and the difficulty of the field and World Boss Raid is quite high.",
  "Key rewards and simplified information regarding the field raid can be obtained by clicking on verifiable raid monsters in the World Map (ALT+M), and keep in mind that Teleport can be used to easily move around.",
  "Drop items vary depending on raid level and difficulty. In the case of Boss Raids, drop items include rare accessories, Boss Weapons, Boss Dolls, Boss Crystals that only the Boss possesses.",
  "Attribute Stone, C Weapon/Armor Enchant Scroll, Sayha’s Blessing/Benefaction",

  "If the character’s level is more than 15 levels higher than the monster, it is marked in ‘blue,’ and the same XP/item drop penalty is applied to the monster. The XP/item drop penalty also applies upon defeating the boss monster when the level difference between Party members/command channel members is greater than 15.",
  "We’ve added permanent game features exclusive to NCW’s Lineage II Aden server. Raid Master Chests and L2 Coin Boxes will now be added to the permanent drop tables of World Raid Bosses and Elite Monsters below:",
