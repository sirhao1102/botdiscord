Activation Chance Before Change After Change 10% 30% Reduced XP/SP rewards for some monsters in the early stages of the \"Fantastical Mirage\" invasion. Reduced the difficulty of tiering up the 'Fantastical Mirage' invasion. Raid Calculation System Raid Calculation System Introduction Added a new Raid Calculation System. Rewards are earned by the party or user with the highest \"contribution\" to the monster kill, not the \"final strike\". If no party is present when a particular monster is killed, you won't receive the reward. When you defeat a specific monster that is subject to the Raid Calculation System, an auction for the monster's drop items begins. The auction lasts 15 seconds per item, and you can participate in the auction by setting a bid amount and pressing the 'Bid' button. After 15 seconds, the character with the highest bid wins, or if the highest bid is the same, the character who bid first wins. The winning bid is divided equally among the party members after taxes are applied, and the winning bidder is included in the distribution. If no one bids, the item is auctioned off and randomly distributed to one of your party members. Low-value items dropped by raid bosses are dropped on the floor instead of being auctioned. The way dropped items are picked up and distributed is based on the existing party/alliance's distribution method. Class Update New Class - Varkas Added a new class 'Varkas'. You can create characters after the maintenance on Tuesday, 4/15. The Varkas class is a member of the Hunter family. The Varkas class is a human race and can only create 'male' characters.

Rebalanced the Training Dungeon Boss Monsters to match the Hunting Zone's difficulty when you select a Hunting Zone below: Select Hunting Zones Boss Name Sel Mahum Barracks Pitron Orc Barracks - Kerr Barracks Kerion Orc Barracks - Turek Barracks Tuhak of Anger Entrance to the Giant's Cave Lakarta Giant's Cave Center Vycant Inside the Giant's Cave Hashepsut World Tower of Insolence Floors 1-4 Rilva World Tower of Insolence Floors 5-9 Ryun World Tower of Insolence Floors 10-12 Chel Auto-Hunt System Made improvements so that available Charging Skills are used before other Active Automated Skills. If the Rush skill is unavailable, the active Automated Skills registered to the shortcut are used in the same order as before.

When switching to the next target during Auto-Hunting, available Charging Skills will now be used before other active Automated Skills. If the target is maintained, Charging Skills won't be used first, and the Skills you have automated to shortcuts will be used in order, as same as before. World Boss Made balance changes and added new skills to Bosses that appear in the World Timed Hunting Zone. Target Boss Monster Antharas’s Incarnation, Behemoth Antharas’s Incarnation, Jin Behemoth Ice Lord Glakias Scary Ice Lord Glakias Other Changes The Warden NPC will now also be summoned in Gludin Village and Oren Castle during Monster Invasions.

Improved the World Server as described below: - Improved the ability to swap pet equipment on the World Server. - Improved Skill enchantments to work on World Servers. - Player Commendation Shop and Ticket items can be used in World Hunting Zone. When resetting the play report, the 'Total Play Time' is also reset. Fixed an issue with losing XP when dying on the rooftop area of the Orc Fortress Battle. Fixed an issue that caused intermittent abnormal damage in PvP situations. Fixed an issue where swapping between two-handed weapons would change the inventory slot location of that equipment. Fixed an issue where the user information window for the person who sent a whisper was not displayed. Improved the lag during the loading process when using tickets with many exchangeable items. Removed the \"Dragon Valley Hill\" Hunting Zone from the Giran Castle Chamberlain's teleport list. Fixed an issue where the Clan Level drop-down list in the 'Join a Clan' System window would only show up to Level 10. Fixed an issue where creating an Elf Character occasionally leads to spawning at abnormal locations. Changed to allow quantitative items registered to a shortcut to remain in the slot even if they are used up. - For slots that are set to auto-use, the item will automatically be available when you pick it up. 'Longer Sayha's Grace duration' effect has been applied to all servers. - Removed the \"Maintain Saiha's Favor\" effect from the \"Support Café Growth\" skill effect. Changed the target display design. Improved the monsters to teleport instead of walk when returning to their spawn location from traveling too far. Fixed an issue where Pet XP would intermittently decrease when returning to the main server from the World Hunting Zone and Olympiad Stadium.

Vanguard is a Warrior type class that mounts on a beast for battle. Vanguard is only available to Orc males. The Vanguard's main weapon is the spear, and equipping a spear replaces normal attack with single-target attack. The main type of armor worn is Heavy Armor. Vanguard cannot equip a shield. The Vanguard class has an exclusive appearance, and the appearance of armor can be changed by using the Armor Change skill. The class transfer tree of the Vanguard class is as follows. Base Class 1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class Orc Spear Tracker Lancer Vanguard The default stats of the Vanguard class are as follows: STR 40 INT 15 DEX 30 WIT 10 CON 45 MEN 30 Vanguards have access to exclusive mounts and are unable to use certain mounts.

You can register an enchant target item by dragging it from the sub inventory next to the main UI, or by double-clicking or right-clicking it. The enchant success rate, which is determined based on the registered enchant scroll and target item, is displayed on the UI. Hovering the mouse over the ? button above the success rate shows the updated success rate details, including enchantment aid effects, item, and skill. When both an enchant scroll and a target item are registered, the Details button on the top right becomes activated. Click the button to see the target item's stats before and after enchantment as well as the item rewarded for failed enchantment. After registering an enchant scroll and a target item, press the Enchant button to start enchantment. To cancel enchantment, press the Abort button before the enchantment animation ends. For enchantments that are higher than a certain stage, the blind animation is played before the enchantment result is displayed. (The stage for this effect varies with items.) To see the enchantment result, press the View Result button in the blind animation. Even if you close the Enchant UI or log out in this state, the completed enchantment will not be canceled. If enchantment succeeds, the enchantment result page shows the information of the enchanted target item. If enchantment fails, it shows the item rewarded for failed enchantment. Press the Continue button on the enchantment result page to maintain the enchant scroll and target item in the slots. If the previous enchantment failed, only the enchant scroll will remain in the slot. To reset all the registered slots, press the Reset button on the Enchant UI. Added a multi enchantment function. To use the multi enchantment function, press the Multi Enchant tab on the Enchant UI. For multi enchantment, you can use only those enchant scrolls that increase the common enchant stage by 1 on success and destroy the target item on failure. You cannot use Blessed, Protection, Cursed, or Solid type enchant scrolls for this purpose. After registering an enchant scroll, you can register an equipment item that the scroll can enchant by dragging it to a slot or by double-clicking or right-clicking it. To remove the item from the slot, double-click or right-click it. The current enchant stage and enchant success rate are displayed on the icon of the equipment registered in the slot. You can register up to 15 equipment items but not more than the quantity of enchant scrolls you have. You can set a final enchant goal. If the quantity of enchant scrolls required for the goal and registered items exceeds that of your enchant scrolls, the final enchant goal is automatically adjusted. Pressing the Enchant button starts enchantment from stage 0 to stage 1 to next stages in order. To cancel enchantment, press the Abort button before the gauge on the UI is filled up. As the gauge is filled up, enchantment is completed.’ Whenever each enchant stage is completed, the enchantment result is applied to the equipment item slot. If enchantment succeeds, the enchant stage and enchant success rate will be displayed. If enchantment fails, the item will disappear. If the final enchant goal is higher than a certain stage, the blind animation will be played before the enchantment result of the final stage is output. To see the enchantment result, press the View Result button in the blind animation. Even if you close the Enchant UI or log out in this state, the completed enchantment will not be canceled. Once all enchantments are completed, the final result page shows the items rewarded for failed enchantment and those resulting from successful enchantment. To maintain the registered enchant scroll and item slots, press the Continue button on the final result page. To reset all the slots, press the Reset button. Enchant stones and enchantment aid effects cannot be used for multi enchantment. Added the Challenge Point system.

You can open the Enchant UI by using an enchant scroll item.

The enchant success rate, which is determined based on the registered enchant scroll and target item, is now displayed on the UI.

After registering an enchant scroll and a target item, press the Enchant button to start enchantment. To cancel enchantment, press the Abort button before the enchantment animation ends. For enchantments that are higher than a certain stage, the blind animation is played before the enchantment result is displayed. (The stage for this effect varies with items.) To see the enchantment result, press the View Result button in the blind animation. Even if you close the Enchant UI or log out in this state, the completed enchantment will not be canceled. If enchantment succeeds, the enchantment result page shows the information of the enchanted target item. If enchantment fails, it shows the item rewarded for failed enchantment.

You cannot use Blessed, Protection, Cursed, or Solid type enchant scrolls for this purpose. After registering an enchant scroll, you can register an equipment item that the scroll can enchant by dragging it to a slot or by double-clicking or right-clicking it. To remove the item from the slot, double-click or right-click it. The current enchant stage and enchant success rate are displayed on the icon of the equipment registered in the slot. You can register up to 15 equipment items but not more than the quantity of enchant scrolls you have. You can set a final enchant goal. If the quantity of enchant scrolls required for the goal and registered items exceeds that of your enchant scrolls, the final enchant goal is automatically adjusted. Pressing the Enchant button starts enchantment from stage 0 to stage 1 to next stages in order. To cancel enchantment, press the Abort button before the gauge on the UI is filled up. As the gauge is filled up, enchantment is completed.’ Whenever each enchant stage is completed, the enchantment result is applied to the equipment item slot. If enchantment succeeds, the enchant stage and enchant success rate will be displayed. If enchantment fails, the item will disappear. If the final enchant goal is higher than a certain stage, the blind animation will be played before the enchantment result of the final stage is output. To see the enchantment result, press the View Result button in the blind animation. Even if you close the Enchant UI or log out in this state, the completed enchantment will not be canceled. Once all enchantments are completed, the final result page shows the items rewarded for failed enchantment and those resulting from successful enchantment.

    "content": "Lineage II | Castle Siege is Now Live! Castle Siege is Now Live! ADEN 9/27/2021 | Patch Notes | by Sunshine The Castle Siege update is now live! Log in and lay siege to claim your Clan victory! Castle Sieges Event Duration : Every Sunday at 20:00 – 21:00 server time (1 hour) Registration : Attacker/Defender : Every Sunday from 18:00 - 20:00 server time (2 hours) Mercenary Application/Recruitment: Every Sunday from 18:00 - 20:00 server time (2 hours) With this update comes a new feature to further challenge Clans and the chance to receive helpful Clan benefits! Defeat your enemies to seize the castle for uses such as taxes and additional XP. How to Participate To participate in a Siege, either enroll for the attacking or defending party or join as a mercenary for the Clans already registered. Take heed, Mercenaries cannot own a castle—to own a castle requires registration as the attacking or defending party before the start of a Siege. Register as Attackers Click on the Siege button to enroll for the attacking party, recruit or apply to be a mercenary. Only the leaders of Clans level three or higher or Clan members who are granted the right to deal with the attacking/defending party qualify for enrollment for the attacking party. Use the Siege button that appears on the screen before the Siege starts (on Sundays, 18:00 – 20:00 server time). Enrollment is over once the Siege begins. Register as Defenders The requirements for registering as the defending party are the same as for the attacking party. The Clan that owns the castle is automatically enrolled for the defending party. Clans that don’t own the castle can register for the defending party by clicking the Siege button. Like application rules for the attacking party, enrollment for the defending party is over before the Siege starts (on Sundays, 18:00 – 20:00). Please note that registration for the defending party is only processed after the leader of the castle-owning Clan approves it. How to Play When a Siege begins, the inside of the castle and some of the neighboring areas are turned into a battlefield. A system message will tell you whether you’re on the battlefield or not. Sieges occur within the Castle of Giran and Castle of Goddard every Sunday for 1 hour starting from 20:00 server time. In the unlikely case of the server being unavailable or getting interrupted during a Siege, the Siege time will be extended for time lost. The HP and other statuses of the defending NPCs, the gates, camps will be the same as before the server down when the Siege restarts. Please note that all players within the battlefield will be unable to move before all NPCs are spawned. When a Siege starts, the attacking and defending parties engage in large-scale, close fight combat. Once the Siege starts and the surrounding area of the castle becomes a battlefield, the attacking party goes to the closest town where the Siege takes place. In contrast, the defending party goes to the inner castle township inside the castle. All Clan members inside the castle who haven’t enrolled for the defending party will be transported to the closest town. When a Siege starts, the attacking party should attempt to get into the castle to destroy the Holy Artifact in the Imprinting Room. Once the Holy Artifact is destroyed, the Guardian of Giran/Goddard appears between the outer and inner castle. Suppose the Clan leader of the attacking party uses an Imprint skill on the Guardian of Giran/Goddard and successfully imprints on it. In that case, the Clan achieves a mid-victory, and the attacking/defending party categories switch. The Guardian of Imprinting appears between the outer and inner castle after the Holy Artifact is destroyed. Other Clans of the attacking party, which failed to imprint and the Clans of the defending party are now the attackers. They can go on looking for a chance to imprint throughout the Siege. The Clan that last imprints by the end of the Siege will be the owner of the castle. Siege Rules Clans within a battlefield where a Siege takes place must comply with a different set of combat rules from regular fields. The same applies to the death penalty as well. Players participating in a Siege are divided into friendly forces, enemies, or neutral players, depending on their relationships with each other. The attackers and the defenders are enemies. Since members of the same Clan are on the same force, any Clan cannot have its members both on the attacking and defending sides. All players who don’t belong to the attacking or defending party are neutral. Whether the attacking or defending party, friendly forces, enemies, or neutral relationships, are marked on one symbol that hovers over the Clan mark. PK scores are not counted within the battlefield. Players can quickly rejoin the Siege by resurrecting in a nearby resurrection area designated to the attacking party within the Siege battlefield. Default attack and AoE magic skills can also be cast on players who are friendly forces within the Siege battlefield. Resurrection-related items and magic skills cannot be used within the Siege battlefield. Some active skills bestowed upon items cannot be used within the Siege battlefield. Players don’t lose XP upon death within the Siege battlefield. Attacks between friendly forces, enemies, and neutral players are decided as below: Character status Relationship in battlefield Physical / Magic Buff / Heal Debuff AoE Buff / Heal AoE Debuff Normal Enemies / neutral ○ Default target ○ X ○ Friendly forces Default target ○ Default target ○ Default target Purple Enemies / neutral X X X X X Friendly forces X X X X X Chaotic Enemies / neutral X X X X X Friendly forces X X X X X XP Penalty Players don’t lose XP upon death within the Siege battlefield, so they can freely enjoy the Siege. This also applies to the death between enemies and death by a neutral character. Collision Check A character cannot pass through an enemy character (for a normal attack) in the Siege battlefield and vice versa. Castle Taxes When a Siege ends, taxes are deposited to the castle vault, and the Castle Lord has the authority to change the tax rate from 0 – 10%. The castle takes 100% of all the taxes collected without paying a sum of money to the dominating castle. Castle Tax Rate Application All merchant NPCs in each hunting zone and town now belong to the castle owners and have to pay the tax rate imposed by the castle (except for Clan Hall Merchant NPCs). Spectator Mode The Spectator Mode, where one can watch a Siege, has been upgraded so one can now freely move around the Siege battlefield while watching the Siege. Mercenary System Here is where you sort out who is a friend and who is a foe. Those who don’t belong to a Clan can still partake in a Siege through the Mercenary system. Hire some mercenaries to help you turn the tide of battle every Sunday beginning October 3! Mercenary Recruitment Clans that become the attackers or defenders can recruit mercenaries, up to 100 mercenaries per Clan. Mercenary recruitment and cancellation open every Sunday at 18:00 – 20:00 server time. If there is at least one mercenary applicant after recruitment opens, the recruitment cannot be canceled. Mercenary Application Individual players or players whose Clans haven’t enrolled for the attacking/defending party can still participate in a Siege by applying to be a mercenary. Choose the Clan of your liking among the Clans that register for mercenary recruitment during the recruitment period (on Sundays, 18:00 – 20:00 server time) and fight in a Siege as a mercenary for the Clan you choose. Who qualifies for a Mercenary Lv. 40+ characters (1 character per account) Clan members who are not enrolled for the attacking or defending party Characters whose Clan is not at war with another Clan registered for the attacking/defending party Characters who don’t belong to any Clan Mercenary Characteristics Joining a Siege as a mercenary will change your character name and Clan mark to guarantee anonymity.

    "content": "Lineage II | Aden Launch Patch Notes Aden Launch Patch Notes ADEN 8/10/2021 | Patch Notes | by Sunshine Tomorrow’s the big day and we’ve been working hard to bring Lineage II Aden to you. We highlighted the biggest features through detailed preview articles, but here is a list of everything that you can expect when Lineage II Aden launches. Pending any unplanned issues, the Aden service will officially open at 9:00 AM PDT. Two New Classes Two new classes premier for the Aden server launch; the Death Knight class (Male Human, Male Elf, Male Dark Elf) and the new Storm Blaster class for the Sylph race. Death Knight Class During the golden age of Elmoreden, the Knights of Death, a secret subjugation group consisting of male-only Human, Elf, and Dark Elf warriors, dedicated their lives to preventing the fire dragon, Valakas, from gaining strength to bring peace to Aden. Take a closer look at the Death Knight through our detailed preview . Storm Blaster Class Evolved from the Ertheia, a once great and noble race, the Sylph Storm Blasters are hybrid combat with a tactical edge and style of fighting that consists of attack patterns proficient in both melee and ranged engagement and high maneuverability. Their speedy style of combat allows them to turn the tide of battle in their favor. For more details, visit the Storm Blaster class preview guide . Class Changes for Aden All 36 classes have been overhauled completely to have their own self-sufficient buffs to allow for smooth and efficient solo hunting on the Aden server. Certain class skills will require spellbooks to learn that can be obtained from raid bosses or through special crafting. General transformation skills with different boosts have been added to all classes (except Death Knight and Jin Kamael, which have their own transformations). Characters can transform into a Pirate, Dark Assassin, White Assassin, and a White Guardian (requires a spellbook). Class Transfer System The class you select can advance and that is called the Class Transfer System. There is up to 3 class transfers and it can be done by completing several steps (Clan transfer UI and Lv. 76 quest). The class branches out starting at the 2nd class transfer, so it is crucial to select the class you wish to advance to.

Each stat impacts the character’s combat prowess, and this combat prowess can be seen in the character information window. ◆ Basic Stats Basic Stat Combat Effect Explanation STR Attack Power P. Critical Damage As a stat that shows STR, it is closely related to Attack Power. This is one of the most important basic stats for Fighter type classes that use P. Atk. Attack Power increases additionally if above STR 40, so Fighters who possess STR 40 and Dark Fighter, Orc Fighter possess higher Attack Power. DEX P. Accuracy P. Evasion Atk. Spd. P. Critical Rate As a stat that shows DEX, it is closely related to most combat figures related to P. Atk. It has the ability to increase Evasion and Atk. Spd. so it is a stat that is very important to Rogue type classes that wear Light Armor. It is the most important basic stat for classes related to STR and P. Atk. CON Maximum HP / HP Recovery Weight / Breath Shield Def. Success Rate As a stat that shows CON, it is closely related to maximum HP and HP recovery. It is one of the most important basic stats to classes that prioritize survival in combat. CON is related to physical attributes such as Stun and Bleed, so players who enjoy Castle Sieges and PvP should consider CON increase dyes. INT M. Atk. M. Critical Damage As a stat that shows INT, it is closely related to M. Atk. It is the most important basic ability for classes who use M. Atk. such as Wizard type classes. Unlike Fighter type classes, INT is a core stat for Wizards with little pattern restrictions. However, Healer type classes cannot change INT figures. WIT M. Accuracy / M. Evasion Casting Spd. M. Def. Rate M. Critical Rate As a stat that shows off WIT, it is closely related to Casting Speed and M. Accuracy. WIT is one of the most important basic stats to Wizard type classes and is comparable to Fighter type’s DEX. It is a very important element in combat that increases Casting Speed, so players who enjoy Castle Sieges and PvP should consider WIT increase dyes. MEN Maximum MP / MP Recovery M. Def. M. Cancel Rate As a stat that shows off MEN, it is closely related to maximum MP and MP recovery. It is one of the most important basic stats to Wizard type classes and is comparable to Fighter type’s CON. It is related to mental attributes, so players who enjoy Castle Sieges and PvP should consider MEN increase dyes. Basic stats differ based on race, and additional stats can be acquired through equipment/dyes/items/skills. Races The Lineage II Aden server has seven races that coexist peacefully. Each race is distinguished significantly from each other in characteristics, as well as in appearance, so classes of the same type will slightly differ from each other in combat stats. Therefore, you should choose a class that fits you the best based on the unique stats of each race. Sylph The Sylphs are one of the Ertheia races created by Einhasad with the Soul of Wind, that developed on their own in Aden. They can use the power of spirits and worship the God of Wind, Sayha. STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 40 35 40 20 10 25 Sylphs move quickly and act agilely, and mainly use a shooter and the power of Spirit. After completing the 1 st class transfer, their attack skill motions vary depending on the distance to the target, and their special skills deal different effects depending on the target. Human Humans were created by Gran Kain but they worship Einhasad, the Goddess of Light. They've mastered the powers of combat as well as magic and they are adept in any class role. ◆ Fighter STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 40 30 43 21 11 25 Human Fighters are Fighters in the most basic form. All their basic stats are well-balanced so that they are good at adapting to any situation, but that also means they do not have any specialties. You will be able to make up for this by transferring to another class that is specialized for one of the stats. ◆ Mystic STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 22 21 27 41 20 39 A Human Mystic will be the best you can get when you need a character that specializes in one thing. Human Mystics are able to use all elemental, support, white, and black magic, except Orc’s Evil Spirits magic. Each class superior to the Human Mystic specializes in using each of the magics, making them even more powerful. Elf Created by Einhasad through the Mother Tree, Elves are agile and dexterous Deeply in tune with the forces of nature, they worship Eva, the Goddess of Water, and dwell in the protection of the Mother Tree. ◆ Elven Fighter STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 36 35 35 23 14 26 With higher DEX than other races, Elves show higher Evasion Rate and Attack Accuracy Rate. Also, they show great mobility in battles with high Movement Speed and Attack Speed. Another reason why you will find them attractive is, they are able to use support magic of varying kinds and have the recovery skill ‘Elemental Heal’. Elves are better than any other classes at using bows in attack thanks to their high DEX. ◆ Elven Mage STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 21 24 25 37 23 40 Elven Mages, although not able to use black magic, have the ability to reinforce their friendly forces as well as themselves using the power of Spirit. With higher WIT and MEN than other races, they feature high Casting Speed and fast MP recovery. Dark Elf Dark Elves were once of the Elf race. They split off to pursue their worship of Shilen and dark magic, but she proved to be too evil and the Dark Elves now stand on their own. ◆ Dark Fighter STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 41 34 32 25 12 26 With high base Attack Damage and Evasion Rate, Dark Fighters are a good choice when you would like to focus on attacking. However, they have weak Strength, which means they might be at risk if a battle is prolonged. Dark Fighters are a class that kills enemies quickly using fast Attack Speed and high Critical Rate. ◆ Dark Mage STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 23 23 24 44 19 37 Dark Mages specialize in using black magic with higher INT than any other races, which makes them feature the most powerful M. Damage. However, they have low WIT, which is why they have slow Casting Speed. Also, their MP recovers relatively slowly, so you might need to learn how to fight efficiently with this class. Orc Orcs were created by fire to be a race of undying strength and stamina, in worship of the God of Fire Pa'agrio. Once servants of the Giants, Orcs are powerful warriors. ◆ Orc Fighter STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 40 26 47 18 12 27 Orc Fighters never get exhausted by fighting for a long time with their highest Strength, great resistance to poison, and quick HP and MP recovery. However, they have low Accuracy Rate and Evasion Rate and slow Movement Speed. ◆ Orc Mage STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 27 24 31 31 15 42 Unlike other Wizard classes, Orc Mages use unique Evil Spirit magic, such as dealing damage to enemies over time or increasing Strength of their friendly forces. Also, they are as good at fighting as Fighters of other races, with high STR and CON. However, they have slow Casting Speed due to low WIT and lack magic skills that are very efficient. Dwarf Dwarves were made from and worship the God of Earth Maphr. Their heartiness makes them excel at crafting, resource gathering, and heavy combat with multiple enemies. ◆ Dwarven Fighter STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 39 29 45 20 10 27 Dwarves cannot just be evaluated based on their basic stats. They are specialized for economic elements, such as finding and collecting hidden materials from inside monsters or crafting items. Particularly, they are a good choice in that they have great Strength and can carry many items, with high CON. Jin Kamael Jin Kamael were created by the Gods as living combat weapons, but they refused the experiment of their creators and escaped. They use souls of living creatures in battle. STR DEX CON INT WIT MEN 41 35 27 25 20 22 Born as a result of numerous experiments combining the body and soul, Jin Kamael have the ability to use the souls of darkness and light, which gives them the ability to absorb a soul and use the inborn power. They have high P. Atk. and fast Attack Speed. Character Chat Restrictions: The following chat restrictions by level will be implemented for launch week: General Chat (White) – Lv. 1 Whispers (Pink) – Lv. 15 Shout (Orange) – Lv. 35 Trade (Light Pink) – Lv. 35 World Chat (Red) – Lv. 50 Raid Boss System Field raids will be available at launch. One characteristic is that a raid spawns after a specific amount of time with high difficulty, and it provides opportunities to obtain very rare and special items. ◆ Field Raid World Map Field raids designate raid monsters that can be checked in the World Map (ALT+M). There is a difference in the scale of individual and command channel field raids, and the difficulty of the field and World Boss Raid is quite high. ◆ Field Raid Teleport Key rewards and simplified information regarding the field raid can be obtained by clicking on verifiable raid monsters in the World Map (ALT+M), and keep in mind that Teleport can be used to easily move around. Raid Rewards Drop items vary depending on raid level and difficulty.

The XP/item drop penalty also applies upon defeating the boss monster when the level difference between Party members/command channel members is greater than 15. ◆ Raid Master Chests and L2 Coin Boxes We’ve added permanent game features exclusive to NCW’s Lineage II Aden server. Raid Master Chests and L2 Coin Boxes will now be added to the permanent drop tables of World Raid Bosses and Elite Monsters below: Raid Boss Level Zone Vadin (Elite Monster) 80 Tower of Insolence (Appears randomly 1F–4F) Queen Ant 80 Outskirts of Ivory Tower Core 80 Cruma Tower Orfen 80 Outskirts of Sea of Spores Baium 80 Tower of Insolence Zaken 80 Devil's Isle Mul (Elite Monster) 82 Tower of Insolence (Appears randomly 5F–8F) Scarlet Van Halisha (Frintezza Clan Raid) 85 Currently unavailable and will be added in a future content update Echik (Elite Monster) 87 Tower of Insolence (Appears randomly 9F–12F) Hunting Zones The following hunting zones will be available to hunt in at launch: Zone Name Level Range Hill of Hope 2~15 Training Grounds - 1 2~15 Silent Plains 2~15 Immortal Plateau, Northern Region 8~17 Western Mining Zone 8~17 Talking Island, Western Territory 8~19 Elven Forest 8~19 Swampland 13~16 Golden Hills 15~20 Training Grounds - 2 15~20 Whispering Woods 15~20 Ruins of Agony 20~25 Abandoned Camp 25~30 Gorgon Flower Garden 30~35 Death Pass 35~40 Sea of Spores 40~45 Cemetery 45~53 Fields of Massacre 53~58 Plains of Glory 58~64 War-Torn Plains 64~70 Cruma Tower 64~76 Silent Valley 70~76 Bee Hive 70~80 Plains of the Lizardmen 76~80 Tower of Insolence 76~85 Dragon Valley (West) 78~82 Dragon Valley (East) 82~85 Orc Barracks 83~85 Sel Mahum Base 83~85 Note: Several Lv. 85+ hunting zones are displayed on the World Map list, but they will be unavailable until a future update. Special Hunting Zones New types of hunting zones, called special hunting zones have been added to Lineage II Aden that can only be entered for a limited amount of time. The following two special hunting zones will be available at launch: Zone Name Level Range Entry Fee Duration Alligator Island 60+ 200 L2 Coins (Note: L2 Coins are consumed upon each entry) 60 minutes (no recharge stone at launch) Primeval Isle 76+ 10,000 Adena 120 Minutes (additional 720 minutes with recharge stone) Transcendent Dungeons The Transcendent Dungeon is explicitly designed for solo play and an ideal opportunity to gain a high amount of XP in a short amount of time, with plenty of rewards to earn. More information on these six action-packed, horde-style hunting zones can be found in our article: https://www.lineage2.com/news/transcendent-dungeon-preview Auto Hunting The ‘Auto-Hunting’ feature allows skills registered in the Skill Hotbar window to be automatically used. Put it simply, it is a system that allows players to add skills that they are going to use repeatedly in advance and to use them one by one just by clicking on a button. Lineage II provides macros that can be created to automate repeated use of all skills and actions, which is a huge boost for play. Drag and drop a skill one wants to use onto the Skill Hotbar and ‘right-click’ it to activate it. In ‘Turn on Auto Hunt’ status, skills starting from the ‘No. 1’ on the bottom of the Skill Hotbar left-to-right, will be used. (Priority: Skill Hotbars no. 1→ no. 2→ no.3) ◆ Auto Hunting Button Features One can customize the features to better fit their combat style with Auto Pickup, Manner Mode, Auto Target features, etc.: Turn on/off Auto Hunting (shortcut : Alt+Z) Feature that activates ‘Auto Hunting’ Combat Mode (enter in the Chat Window : /combat mode) In PvP, when Combat Mode is turned on, attacks and skills are to be ‘hit/used by default’ without pressing [Ctrl]. Turn on/off Auto Pickup Feature to automatically obtain items dropped in a nearby field Turn on/off Manner Mode (a feature where monsters that are being attacked by other players are not automatically targeted) Melee/ranged auto target Automatically select the closest target between 600/ 1400 ranges. Auto Skill/Supply Use Move skills and items that can be automatically used to the Hotbar and right-click them to use them. One can automate the use of self-buff skills that are needed in hunting on a regular basis. Skills that can be automated will be marked with a green re-use mark in the upper left corner of their icons. Add an auto-use skill to the Skill Hotbar and right-click it to activate auto-use. Once the auto-use feature is activated, the buff will be automatically casted if one does not have the buff or if the buff has less than 3 seconds left.

The information can be viewed through the ranking system icon on the sidebar menu. Character level, PvP, Pets, and Clan rankings have been added. Rankings are calculated based on levels by server and levels by race. If there are characters with the same level and XP, the first to level up successfully will be ranked higher. Characters must be level 40 and have already completed the second-class transfer to appear in the rankings. The ranking history of last 7 days can be viewed in detail located at the top of the ranking UI. Special buffs based on the ranking is applied every day at 6:30 AM Server Time. Characters with Server Ranking Grades 1 to 3 are marked with a special symbol when they chat so that others know that they are high rankers. An exclusive emblem applies to the top ranker of Server Rankings. If the top ranker of Server Rankings is in a peace zone, all characters within a 1000 grid pay respect (social action: Bow) to it. The top ranker receives this greeting of respect 20 seconds after entering the peace zone and receives the greeting again every 3 minutes afterwards. Characters can receive temporary buffs and transformations depending on their ranking. Teleport System You can now teleport to any town or hunting zone using the teleport notification icon The same teleportation interface will now appear when you talk with a town Gatekeeper There are no teleportation fees for characters under level 50. You will be required to pay Adena for teleportation at level 51 and higher. Teleportation cannot be used when Feared, debuffed with Escape Lock, your character is dead, or you are in a special hunting zone. Share Location System Added the Share Location feature that allows players to share their current location with others from the chat window. Players can share their current location with others from the World/General/Trade/Party/Clan/Alliance/Hero/Shout windows with a message by typing /sharelocation command. Using the Share Location feature costs 50 L2 Coin. This feature is unavailable in certain areas (Olympiad/special hunting zones/Heavenly Rift, and other places). Players can check the information about shared locations and teleport there using the Share Location icon from the chat window. Teleporting to a shared location costs 400 L2 Coin. A shared location can be teleported up to 5 times. A shared location works up to 24 hours. Once a player shares a location, others can teleport to that location even after the player who originally shared it logged out. Teleporting to a location shared by oneself costs L2 Coin. Attribute System At Lv. 40, you automatically acquire the Attribute system. To learn more about attributes and spirits, you can visit the NPC Attribute Master Sven in Giran or Aden. When you acquire the Attribute system, the Spirits button in the Character Status window (Alt+T) becomes active. You can access the Attribute system by clicking the Spirits button. There are 4 types of attributes, and each attribute is stronger or weaker against another. Fire > Earth Earth > Wind Wind > Water Water > Fire Attacking monsters with the right attribute allows you to deal greater additional damage in combat. View the monster attribute type in the target window and choose the dominant attribute to counter their attribute. Fishing System An automated fishing system has been added: When a character moves to a fishing area, the ‘Start Fishing’ icon appears automatically. The Fishing icon is displayed regardless of whether or not a Fishing Rod and Bait are equipped. Fishing starts automatically when the icon is clicked, but you must still have a fishing rod and bait equipped in order to begin fishing. There are no level restrictions on fishing. You can purchase a temporary Fishing Rod, Bait, and Fishing Shots from a Fishing Guild Member. Fish icons on the World Map show the locations where you can fish near water. Fishing can be used to obtain XP, SP, and Fish, which can be used to obtain certain fishing skills (Expand Trade/Expand Warehouse). Mission System Missions provide you with something to do every day. The number of missions you complete is displayed over the Mission icon in the notification window. A few missions that appear in the System and Clan tabs cannot be completed until a future update.

When killed by another character in a normal field, the Revenge Notification icon that displays the attacker’s name will be added to the bottom right of the HUD. Click the Revenge Notification icon or Revenge in the menu to bring up the Revenge UI. The Revenge UI saves and provides the following information for up to 6 hours upon death. Your killer character’s level and name Your killer character’s clan Your killer character’s class Your death time Your killer character’s online/offline status The Revenge UI records data in normal PvP and PK situations, including mutually declared clan wars. It doesn’t record data in the following cases: When a monster (or boss) kills you When you play official PvP content (Castle Siege, Arena, and Olympiad) You can see the revenge target’s location saved in the Revenge UI and use the teleport function. You can use the View Location and Teleport functions 5 times a day. These limits are reset every day at 6:30 AM server time. The View Location function is free for the first time but costs Adena later on. The Teleport function moves the revenger character in the Hide state for a short time in order to move them safely and give them an opportunity to attack first. The Teleport function doesn’t support teleporting to special zones, such as peace zones, transcendent dungeons, certain hunting grounds, Siege Battlefields, or castles. You can also request help after the Revenge occurs within the 6-hour timeframe. You can request help from characters within the top 50 of the character rankings or from any of your clan members. You may request help from your own character as well. After you have asked for help, the remaining View Location count is preserved, but any remaining teleports can no longer be used. Any of your characters that have received a help request, including from yourself, can teleport up to 5 times per request. The teleport cost is 100 L2 Coins per use.

The attacker's reputation (Karma) does not relate to the Item Penalty. It is also not applied when defeated by a monster. 1. Losing Items Item Penalty applies only when defeated by another player. Getting defeated by a summoned pet also counts as being defeated by another player. Item Penalty applies to the character's equipped items: Weapon / Equipment / Accessory / Cloak / Pendant / Agathion / Talisman / Gems / etc. Any limited or event items will be excluded from the penalty. The related item is dropped and the color is displayed depending on the item. These items cannot be picked up by other players and can only be recovered through Item Recovery.

Lost items can be recovered using Adena and part of the amount will be delivered to the PVP attacker who killed you. (Fee is excluded when L2 Coin is used) Up to 50 items can be stored and exceeding it will delete the oldest items permanently. (Deleted items cannot be recovered) The fee depends on the type of item and having more items will increase its cost.

Penalties from PK are given separately through the PK System. ◆ Reputation Details Category Details Rep. If the character's Rep. is negative, then they will be a Chaotic Character.

Dislike System Added a dislike system, an opposite concept of the recommendation system. You cannot use a Dislike Ticket on yourself. To use the ticket and change someone’s reputation, select a target and press ‘Dislike’ on the action window or enter the command ‘/dislike’. 10 Dislike Tickets are given to each character by default. 1 Dislike Ticket is recharged every hour, and its count is reset every day at 6:30. Up to 3 Dislike Tickets can be used on one character per day. The character’s name turns to brown according to its reputation. When a character is liked, its name changes to blue. If it is disliked in this state, its name changes to brown. The name of the character that uses the Dislike Ticket is not displayed. L2 Coin Shop The Aden server will have a secondary shop of items that can be purchased with L2 Coins and Adena. The L2 Coins can be obtained from L2 Coin Boxes that are purchasable from the L2 Store for NCoin or can drop from specific elite/raid boss monsters. Your L2 Coin wallet is not shared across characters, servers, or server types (Aden L2 Coin =/ Classic L2 Coin). The L2 Coin Box is a tradable item, but the L2 Coins are not tradable.
